      <description>This blog is not about holy war between Python and C&amp;#43;&amp;#43;.  Someone - C++ is faster than Python&amp;hellip;
Show them this article&amp;hellip;
Note - When you write same code, C++ is way more performant than most of the modern programming Languages. And you will find Python somewhere at the end of the list.
But when you implement these in some real projects, nobody cares about your code and language.</description>

      <title>Feature of Scala</title>

      <description>A short interpretation on some superb features of Scala. I&amp;rsquo;m writting this microblog while learning Scala as a part of my SnT project (gaining insight into different programming languages ​​and understanding different paradigms of programming.)
Scala The name is an acronym from &amp;lsquo;Scala&amp;rsquo;able Language. As it&amp;rsquo;s purpose of introduction was to resolve scalability issues. The evolution of traditional languages such as Java, C#, and C++ has slowed down considerably, and programmers who are eager to use more modern language features are looking elsewhere.</description>

      <description>How to use interfaces in Go? Just as many human-based languages exist, There are dozens of programming languages used in the industry today to communicate with computers. Each language has its own distinct features, though many times there are some similarities between programming languages. If you wish/need to master a programming language, you might wonder which one to learn.After all, it will take time to learn the language, so everyone want to make the right choice.</description>

      <description>I am writing this fun blog while learning different Programming Languages as a part of my college project (gaining insight into different programming languages ​​and understanding different paradigms of programming.)
    General Concepts- Here is a quick overview on Fundamentals of Programming Languages : Similar to human interface languages, which have their own set of rules that have to be followed in order to write correctly in that language, programming languages ​​also follow certain rules.</description>

      <description>Rienforcement Learning to develop AI agents Reinforcement learning (RL) is an area of machine learning concerned with how intelligent agents ought to take actions in an environment in order to maximize the notion of cumulative reward.Reinforcement learning is one of three basic machine learning paradigms, alongside supervised learning and unsupervised learning.
Reinforcement learning differs from supervised learning in not needing labelled input/output pairs be presented, and in not needing sub-optimal actions to be explicitly corrected.</description>
