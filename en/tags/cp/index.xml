      <description>Competitive Coding Resources Here are some CP resources that I found useful.
Why did I write this blog?  Good question! There are plenty of resources out there on how to start competitive programming but what I found missing there were proper links to resources. I also had selfish reasons:- I wanted a short description, which nevertheless contained the major ideas underlying the algorithms, a discussion of their relative strengths and weaknesses, with hints on what is known (and not known, but would be good to know) about these algorithms.</description>
